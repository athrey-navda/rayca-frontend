TASK A: FRONT-END DESIGN
Building an Interface
We are requesing that you precisely imitate the UI demonstrated in the image atached to this file. Your
task is to replicate this design as accurately as possible.
Instructions:

1. Review the atached image to understand the desired UI elements.
2. Use Next.js to recreate the UI and interaction.
3. Aim for pixel-perfect precision in replicating the design seen in the provided sample design.
4. Encourage you to consider details such as using animations, transions, and responsiveness.
5. Once you have completed the task, provide a live demo of your implementation. You can host it
   on a platform of your choice. Providing a deployed version of your code is necessary for
   demonstrating.
6. You must also share your code for a more comprehensive evaluation.

Task Delivery
 Link to live demo
 Code GitHub repository

Step 1:

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.

You can check out [the Next.js GitHub repository](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/) - your feedback and contributions are welcome!

## Deploy on Vercel

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.
